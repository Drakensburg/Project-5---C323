# Project-5---C323
## Background
The Connected Office Initiative (COI) involves the use of IoT devices located throughout the office building that are connected to the network in order to acquire and exchange the data that these devices collect. Different methods might be used to share the data. One way is by using visuals included in a report or dashboard. Different stakeholders may be given access to these reports or dashboards according to their level of involvement. The COI has been informed that a report would be an excellent method to track how their IoT devices are being used.  
As the organization already has all necessary licensing agreements with Microsoft, the report will be developed in Power BI. It is anticipated that all stakeholders would be able to see the same information regarding the status of IoT device registrations on multiple platforms. You are expected to learn and put your newly acquired abilities to use as a part of the COI development team.
